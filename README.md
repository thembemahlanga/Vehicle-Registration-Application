Vehicle-Registration-Application is a simple Java program that helps users register and manage car information through a command-line interface. When the app runs, it asks for the user’s name and surname, then displays a menu with three options: capturing car details, viewing a full report of all registered cars, or exiting the application. Users can enter information such as the car’s make, model, VIN (which must be exactly 17 characters), plate number (with options for old or new format), mileage, and year. All car data is stored in a list and shown in a clean report format. The program is built using object-oriented principles, with a separate Car class that holds the details using encapsulated fields and public methods for access. Everything is managed through structured input, loops, and conditionals in the Main class for a smooth and user-friendly experience.
